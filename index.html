<center><h3>INTERVENTION PROPOSALS FOR LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN QUERÉTARO, MÉXICO</h3></center>
<br>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Santiago de Querétaro, capital of the central Mexico’s
State of Querétaro, has experienced significant
economic and population growth in fifty years. Following
the development of an industrial zone in the north, the
city’s population grew from 60,000 in 1960 to more
than 600,000 in 1990.¹ In more recent years, economic
opportunity and a relatively low crime rate have driven
sustained regional and urban growth.² Every day, 63
new residents move to Querétaro State from parts of
the country;³ - many escaping from violence or seeking
better economic opportunities.
These aggregate statistics mask deep and pervasive
social and economic inequality. Within Santiago
de Querétaro, nearly a third of residents live in
poverty.⁴ Low-income neighborhoods often lack basic
infrastructure or adequate housing – issues often
accentuated by flooding, steep slopes, limited transit
service, and a lack of job opportunities. As the city
has expanded physically, disparities in transportation
accessibility and the quality of natural and built
environments have become wider and more pronounced.</p>

<br>
<h4>Work Process</h4>
<p>
The content in this website is a culmination of the work of eleven City
and Regional Planning students at the University of
Pennsylvania’s School of Design. Over the Spring 2018
semester, we developed public realm projects to improve
low- and moderate- income neighborhoods in Querétaro,
Mexico. We began the project by analyzing the city of
Querétaro to identify neighborhood typologies. During
our week-long site visit, we furthered our understanding
of six key neighborhoods and presented initial project
ideas to our clients at the Municipality of Querétaro’s
Secretary of Mobility (SEMOV). SEMOV was created in
2015 by the city’s mayor, Marcos Aguilar, and is charged
with optimizing a multi-modal transportation network in
the city. In the second half of the semester, we developed
and refined our projects</p>
<br>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>
Fundamentally, this studio is aimed at addressing
inequality. Low-income Queretanos live in areas
vulnerable to environmental disaster, face long
commutes to access job opportunities, and lack sufficient
road and utility infrastructure. These physical challenges
have made addressing the city’s economic disparities
even more complex.
We see our work as an attempt to answer this guiding
question: How can the public realm of low-income
neighborhoods be reimagined to not just address the
challenges of Querétaro’s urban landscape, but to
actually lessen the hardships faced by its lowest-income
residents?</p>
